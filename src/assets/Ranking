Based on the information you provided, here's my advice for creating a ranking system for your local badminton club:

1. **Use an Elo rating system**: The Elo rating system is a simple, transparent, and fair method for calculating rankings based on match results. 
   It's widely used in chess, but it can be adapted for badminton as well.

2. **Assign initial ratings**: Assign an initial rating to each player based on their experience level. For example, beginners could start at 1000, 
  intermediate players at 1200, and advanced players at 1400. These initial ratings will be adjusted as players participate in matches.

3. **Track match results**: After each session, record the match results, including the names of the players and the scores. 
  This data will be used to update the ratings.

4. **Update ratings after each session**: Use the Elo rating formula to update the ratings of all players who participated in the session based on 
  their match results. Players who win matches against higher-rated opponents will gain more rating points, while players who lose to lower-rated 
  opponents will lose more rating points.

5. **Display updated rankings**: After each session, display the updated rankings of all players based on their new Elo ratings. 
  This can be done through a leaderboard or a simple list.

6. **Use a rating period**: To ensure fairness and account for players' improvement or decline over time, consider implementing a 
  rating period (e.g., 6 months or 1 year). At the end of the rating period, reset all players' ratings to their initial values based on their 
  current experience levels, and start a new rating period.

7. **Implement the system using a program**: Develop a simple program or script that can automate the rating calculations, ranking updates, 
  and leaderboard display. This will make the process more efficient and minimize the chances of human error.

8. **Involve the club manager**: Work closely with the club manager to ensure that the ranking system is implemented correctly and meets the 
  club's needs. Provide training and documentation to the club manager on how to use and maintain the ranking system.


By following this approach, you should be able to create a simple, transparent, and fair ranking system for your badminton club that is based 
  solely on match results and considers players' experience levels. The frequent updates and the use of a rating period will ensure that the 
  rankings remain relevant and reflect the current skill levels of the players.

New Rating = Old Rating + K * (Actual Score - Expected Score)
Where:

New Rating is the updated rating for the player after the match.
Old Rating is the player's rating before the match.
K is the K-factor, which determines the maximum amount by which a player's rating can change after a single match. A common value for K is 32 for 
  games like badminton, but it can be adjusted based on your preferences.
Actual Score is the player's actual score in the match (1 for a win, 0 for a loss).
Expected Score is the player's expected score based on the rating difference between the two players. It is calculated using this formula:

Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((Opponent's Rating - Player's Rating) / 400))
Sure, no problem! Let's go back to the original proposal of using the standard Elo rating system without any decay factors. The Elo rating formula 
  is relatively simple and widely used in many competitive games and sports.
The Elo rating formula is used to calculate the new rating for each player after a match based on the result of the match and the rating difference 
  between the two players. Here's the formula:
New Rating = Old Rating + K * (Actual Score - Expected Score)
Where:

New Rating is the updated rating for the player after the match.
Old Rating is the player's rating before the match.
K is the K-factor, which determines the maximum amount by which a player's rating can change after a single match. A common value for K is 32 for 
  games like badminton, but it can be adjusted based on your preferences.
Actual Score is the player's actual score in the match (1 for a win, 0 for a loss).
Expected Score is the player's expected score based on the rating difference between the two players. It is calculated using this formula:

Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((Opponent's Rating - Player's Rating) / 400))
To give you an example, let's say Player A (with a rating of 1200) plays against Player B (with a rating of 1400). If Player A wins the match, 
  their new rating would be calculated as follows:

Calculate the expected score for Player A:
Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((1400 - 1200) / 400)) = 0.276
Calculate the new rating for Player A:
New Rating = 1200 + 32 * (1 - 0.276) = 1223.2

So, Player A's new rating after winning against the higher-rated Player B would be 1223.2.
The beauty of the Elo rating system is that it adjusts the ratings based on the expected outcome of the match. If a lower-rated player beats a 
  higher-rated player, they gain more rating points, and vice versa.

For doubles matches where the partners are not fixed, you'll need to make some adjustments to the standard Elo rating formula to account for the team 
  dynamic. Here's one approach you could take:

1. **Assign team ratings**: Instead of using individual player ratings, calculate a team rating for each pair of players in a doubles match. The team 
  rating can be calculated as the average of the individual player ratings or by using a weighted average that gives more weight to the higher-rated 
  player.

2. **Use the team ratings in the Elo formula**: Apply the Elo rating formula using the team ratings instead of individual player ratings. Treat each 
  doubles match as a contest between two teams.

3. **Update individual player ratings**: After each match, update the individual player ratings based on the change in their team's rating. One way 
  to do this is to distribute the rating change proportionally based on the individual player's contribution to the team rating.

Here's an example of how you could implement this:

Let's say Player A (rating 1200) and Player B (rating 1400) form a team and play against Player C (rating 1300) and Player D (rating 1500). 
  The team ratings would be:

- Team AB rating = (1200 + 1400) / 2 = 1300
- Team CD rating = (1300 + 1500) / 2 = 1400

If Team AB wins the match, you would calculate the new team rating for Team AB using the standard Elo formula, treating it as a contest between two 
  teams with ratings 1300 and 1400.

Suppose the new team rating for Team AB becomes 1325. Then, you could update the individual player ratings as follows:

- Player A's new rating = 1200 + (1325 - 1300) * (1200 / (1200 + 1400))
- Player B's new rating = 1400 + (1325 - 1300) * (1400 / (1200 + 1400))

This way, the rating change is distributed proportionally based on the player's contribution to the team rating.

You can adjust the way you calculate team ratings and distribute rating changes to individual players based on your preferences and the dynamics of 
  your club's doubles matches.

The key is to treat each doubles match as a contest between two teams, calculate team ratings, and then update individual player ratings based on the 
  team's performance and their contribution to the team rating.
